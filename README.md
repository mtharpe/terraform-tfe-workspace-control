# terraform-tfe-workspace-control
This is a workspace control for demo environment. You can use this, as well as the different branches to get access to different demos. Recently I have updated this repo to a much simplier way of dealing with credentials by using Terraform Cloud/Enterprise Variable Sets.

:warning: This will require a TFE API key as well as well as admin access to the workspace/org that you wouuld like to control.

## Example

```ruby
## Consul Demo Workspace
 resource "tfe_workspace" "aws_consul_demo_setup" {
   name         = "aws-consul-demo"
   organization = var.org_name
   queue_all_runs = false
   vcs_repo {
     identifier     = "someusername/consul-aws-demo"
     branch         = "master"
     oauth_token_id = var.oauth_token_id
  }
}
```
